			<h1>About me</h1>
			<h2>Summer Time</h2>
			<p>I am an Industrial Designer. <br /> During this summer I drink wine and went to the movies. <br /> Why did I do that you would ask?
			Mainly because Sven told us to have as much relaxing time as possible due to our forthcoming boot camp.<br /> 
			Here is picture of me drinking wine....Like a sir!</p>
